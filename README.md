# Tips - C++

1. FASTER input and output 

```cpp
ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);
```

1. Don’t use `<< endl`  for line breaks, use `"\n"` ; it’s faster
2. Don’t do this:

```cpp
int a = 123456789;
long long b = a*a;
cout << b << "\n"; // -1757895751 
// Code copied from Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen
```

Instead change `int a` to `long long` or do:

```cpp
long long b = (long long)a*a;
```

1. Write your program faster by using `typedef`

```cpp
typedef long long ll // Whenever you use ll in the program, it refers to long long

ll a = 5034059340; // Means long long a = 5034059340;
```

1. Convert `int`  to `string`  and vice versa

```cpp
// int to string
#include<string>
int x = 23984;
string yay = to_string(x);

// string to int
string testing = "2342"; // String should be a number
int yay = stoi(testing); // Convert to int
```

1. Convert a **number digit**  `char`  to `int`

```cpp
char x = '8'; // a number digit
int y = x - 48; // The value 8 is now stored in y
```

### Stacks

Last in, First out: LIFO (like a stack of plates)

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/720d6423-56eb-4191-81c5-3adbbc06b7f8/Untitled.png)

### Queues

First in, First out FIFO (like an ice cream truck line up)

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8714b6ef-7194-4877-b579-38cca819c12e/Untitled.png)

### Iterators

An iterator points to a value in a data structure. For example, if we have a vector, `v`,  

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a4dbc32f-a488-4c67-82ef-eff46ee4fe36/Untitled.png)

Notice that `v.end()` points outside the last element in `v`

Use `*v.begin()` to print out the value an iterator points (change code `v.begin()` to an iterator name)

## Sets

### Intro

There are `set` and `unordered_set` that have the same operations. Note that all elements in sets are distinct. So inserting the same element again won’t change the set

*Use `#include<iterator> #include<set>` or `#include<`

- `set` operations are in $O(\log n)$
- `unordered_set` is based on a hash table, operations are on average $O(1)$ time

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6e32dfa6-07bd-4a44-a334-5c67ff533993/Untitled.png)

### Accessing elements in a set

Use the function `find(x)` NOT `set_name[]` to access values in a set. Note `find(x)` returns an iterator that points to the element `x` .

## Maps

A map is a pair: a key and it’s corresponding value (analogy: a key unlocks a unique door, and a door can represent a value)

You can think an array as a key-value pair. The index of the array corresponds to a unique value. You can use

- `map` ”based an a balanced binary search tree and accessing elements takes $O(\log n)$ time” (section 5.2.2 of Guide to Competitive Programming)
- `unordered_map` ”uses hashing and accessing elements takes $O(1)$ time on average” (section 5.2.2 of Guide to Competitive Programming)
- Remember to include `#include<map>`  or `#include<unordered_map>`

Here’s the syntax:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/47b2eed6-42f4-49fd-94bc-1c6bfcb92f0f/Untitled.png)

You can also initialize a map like this:

```cpp
unordered_map<string,int> testing {
  {"testing", 5}, {"yellow", 6}, {"Hello", 2}
  };
// Note uniform initialization is used here
// Uniform initialization: initialize variables using {value} instead of = value
```

And check if a key exists using:

```cpp
if (testing.count("somekey")) {
// The key exists
}
```

To list out keys and values, you can do this:

```cpp
for (auto x : testing){
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << "\n";
}
// x.first is the key
// x.second is the corresponding value
// note we use x.first NOT testing.first
```

Or in C++ 17 onwards, you can use this: (called structure bindings)

```cpp
for(const auto& [key, value] : testing) {
  cout << key << ": " << value << "\n"; 
}
```

# Tips - Misc.

## Split array into 2

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void print(vector<int> arr){
  for (auto x: arr){
    cout << x << " ";
  }
}
int main() {
  vector<int> test = {1,2,3,4,5};
  int mid = test.size()/2;
  vector<int> left(test.begin(), test.begin()+ mid);
  vector<int> right(test.begin()+mid, test.end());
  print(left);
  cout << "\n----------------\n";
  print(right);
  
}
```

## Arithmetic series

An arithmetic series is when the difference between any 2 consecutive terms is the same. For example, $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ and  $\{-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7 … \}$  are arithmetic series because they have a common difference between terms. 

<aside>
💡 $S_n$  represents the sum of a series with $n$ terms
$a$ represents the first term in a series
$d$ represents the common difference in an arithmetic series
$r$ represents the ratio between any two terms in a geometric series
$t_n$ represents $n^{th}$ term in a series

</aside>

> Sum of arithmetic series: $S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a + a + (n-1)(d))$ or $S_n=\frac{n}{2} \cdot (t_1+t_n)$
> 

> $t_n = a + (n-1)(d)$
> 

If you need to find the sum numbers like 1+2+3+4+5…., don’t use a `for` loop. Apply the formula or alternatively use the formula $\displaystyle\sum_{t=0}^{n}1+2+3+ ... +n = \frac{1}{2}\cdot (n)(n+1)$

```cpp
// Don't do this:
int sum{}; int n = 100;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
sum += i;
}
// Do this, it's faster
int sum{}; int n = 100;
sum = n*(n+1)/2
```

## Geometric series

To get the next term, you multiply by the same number each time. A geometric series is when the ratio between two consecutive terms is the same.

> Sum of a geometric series: $\displaystyle \frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}$
> 

> $t_n = ar^{(n-1)}$
> 

## Set theory

A set is a collection of objects (objects can be numbers, strings, etc.). For example, $X=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ is an example of a set. Note **sets are unordered and each object is distinct.**  

- [ ]  Add use in competitive programming

### Set operations

- **Intersection** $A \cap B$: The elements two sets have in common. i.e. if $A=\{2,4,6,8\}$ and $B=\{4,8\}$, then $A \cap B = \{4,8\}$
- **Union** $A \cup B$: Combine elements of $A$ and $B$ into one set
- **Complement** $\bar{A}$: Every element NOT in $A$. Depends on a *universal set*, which tells every possible element that could be in a set. So if a universal set was $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ and $A = \{1,2,3\}$, then $\bar{A}=\{4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$
- **Difference** $A \setminus B$**:** Every element in $A$ but not in $B$, like $A$ minus $B$. See the following [image](https://www.math-only-math.com/difference-of-sets-using-Venn-diagram.html):

### Set notation

|  Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| $|A|$ | The size of a set (the number of elements). Also called cardinality |
| $A \subset B$ | $A$ is a subset of $B$: each element of A is also in B |
| $\emptyset$ | Means set is empty |
| $4 \in \R$  |  4 is in the real number set |
| $4 \notin \R$ | 4 is NOT in the real number set |
| $\mathfrak{P}(A)$ or $P(A)$ |  Refers to all subsets of a set (in this case, a set called $A$). There are $2^{|A|}$ subsets if you include the original set and an empty set as a subset |

## Recursive algorithms

- call a function inside a function
- add more later

## Backtracking

- start with an empty solution set
- Extend solution set at each step of your algorithm
- For example, consider finding all the ways to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard, so that no queen can attack another queen.
- Begin by placing a queen on the first row. This tells you where you can place the next queen

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/115e3281-7dc8-4c32-be99-8825f7bad0e9/Untitled.png)

- You get a partial solution; continue this until you find all the solutions
- Implementation (taken from Guide to Competitive Programming by Anti L)

```cpp
void search(int y) { 
if (y == n) {
 count++; 
return;
}
for (int x=0;x<n; x++) {
 if (col[x] || diag1[x+y] || diag2[x-y+n-1]) continue; 
col[x] = diag1[x+y] = diag2[x-y+n-1] = 1;
 search(y+1); 
col[x] = diag1[x+y] = diag2[x-y+n-1] = 0;
}
}

```

$n$ is size of board
code assumes rows and columns are numbered from 0 to $n-1$
place a queen on row $y$

`col`stores the columns containing a queen. `diag1` and `diag2` keep track of the diagonals (queen on next row cannot be on diagonal

## Bit operations

- `int` are stored as 32 bits in memory
- `&` operator is cool

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7395065a-b76d-4cb7-a8f4-4fbc975488b2/Untitled.png)

- You can check if numbers are even/odd using this. `if x&1 = 0` the number is even, and `x&1=1` if x is odd (think of last digit in binary representation)
- There are other bit operations (i.e. XOR, or bit shifts) but I don’t think they’re relevant for CCC so I’m going to skip those.

## Time Complexity

- Time complexity estimates how long a program will take to execute for some given inputs
- Calculating time complexity is useful to find out whether your program will TLE without having to write the program. It helps you explore the fastest solutions
- “Asymptotic upper bound” is used with Big O notation
    - means the worst possible performance of your algorithm
    - Labelled as O(…), where … is some function

### Big O notation rules

- Single commands have time complexity of O(n)

i.e.

```cpp
a++;
b--;
int c = a+b;
b = 5;
// this program runs in O(1) time complexity.
// In other words, there are no inputs so the computation 
// time is always the same when you run this program
```

- O(n): a loop! if a loop runs n times, it has time complexity of O(n)
- If you have a loop inside a loop, then your time complexity is O($n^2$). This is because it takes $n^2$ steps to execute the for loop.
- Similarly, for $i$ nested loops iterating $n$ times each, the time complexity is O($n^i$)
- If you have a program of many steps i.e.:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
// do something
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
// do something
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
	for (int (i = 0; i < n; ++i){
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
				// 3 nested loops
		}
	}
// do something
}
```

- The time complexity of the algorithm is the biggest one. So in the program above, the time complexity is O($n^3$) since the step of the program that takes the longest is the triple-nested for loop
- Sometimes your time complexity depends on many variables. i.e. consider the nested loop below:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
	for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j){
		// do something
	}
}
```

- In this case, the time complexity is O(nm)

### Time complexity in recursive functions

- Depends on how many times recursive function is called
- … and time complexity of a single call

i.e.

```cpp
void f(int n) {
	if (n == 1) return;
	f(n-1)
}
```

- A single call of the function `void f` is O(1). But you end up calling it recursively $n$ times. So the time complexity is O(n)
- Here’s another example (a bit more difficult)

```cpp
void g(int n) {
  if (n == 1) return;
	g(n-1);
	g(n-1);
}
```

- Each function call has time complexity of O(1).
- The first function call for some $n$ puts $n-1$ and $n-1$ in the execution stack. Then, you have 4 ($n-2$) in the execution stack. Then  8 ($n-3$) in the executation stack, and so on.
- So we see that the time complexity is O($2^n$)

### Common time complexities

[Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet (Know Thy Complexities!) @ericdrowell (bigocheatsheet.com)](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

### Estimating time complexities

- Use this to decide what type of algorithm is appropriate to solve CCC problems. For Junior problems, brute force probably works for J1-J3 and maybe J4.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fe486aea-6358-4a1c-87ac-08a3a22a0b5c/Untitled.png)

- $n \log n$ is time complexity for sorting algorithms
    - or maybe a recursive function, of $n$ function calls with each function call with a time complexity of $\log n$

### Maximum Subarray Sum

- Suppose you have an array of $n$ elements
- Find the maximum sum of consecutive elements (called subarray)
- You can do it brute force, by checking each combination.
- Or you can do it O(n)

## Sorting Algorithms

- Rearrange an array so all the elements are in increasing order

### Bubble sort

- Check two elements at a time. If they are out of order swap them. Repeat until array is sorted

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	vector<int> unsorted = { 1,23,4,9,10,10,230,30 };
	for (int i = 0; i < unsorted.size(); ++i) {
		for (int j = 0; j < unsorted.size() - 1; ++j) {
			if (unsorted[j] > unsorted[j + 1]) {
				swap(unsorted[j], unsorted[j + 1]);
			}
		}
	}
	for (auto x : unsorted) {
		cout << x << " "; 
	}
	return 0;
}
```

- Worst case scenario: you need to make n^2 swaps (i.e. the array is initially ordered greatest to least)
    - technically n(n-1)/2 but that’s O($n^2$)

### Merge sort
